                <p>The cultural capital of Maharashtra, Pune was once home to the mighty Marathas, and retains their legacy in the many monuments it is home to, as well as the rich culture which is lovingly preserved by the people of the city. Pune is called the Oxford of the East and is fast emerging as the preferred destination for several multinational companies too. With opportunities for education, jobs and a vibrant nightlife, Pune attracts youngsters from all over the country. <br> These money-savvy youngsters seek the convenience of self-drive cars without the liability of buying and owning one.  Zoomcar fills this need with a well-maintained fleet of cars from every segment. Choose a Zoomcar self-drive car rental in Pune and experience the convenience it provides. </p>

                <h1>CAR RENTAL IN PUNE</h1>
                <p> For frequent travelers shuttling between Pune to Mumbai on a regular basis, taking a car for rent in Pune is ideal as they have the convenience of embarking on the journey at any time of the day. The well maintained Mumbai-Pune expressway is a pleasure to drive on. For those visiting the temple town of Shirdi from Pune, a rental car would be more reasonable and convenient when compared to a chauffeur driven car as the queues at the temples are unpredictable. It is a 4-hour drive from <a href="">Pune to Shirdi.</a></p>
