            <h1>SELF DRIVE CAR RENTALS IN BANGALORE</h1>
            <p>Bangalore is a burgeoning cosmopolitan city with a young urban population. Besides the all-inclusive
                feel, the city is witnessing a shifting culture that calls for an equal focus on work and leisure.
                Almost every work day ends in a relaxing meal with friends, and frequent road trips are the norm. With
                youngsters increasingly viewing driving as a pleasure rather than a chore, self drive car rentals have
                emerged as the answer to a prayer. </p>
