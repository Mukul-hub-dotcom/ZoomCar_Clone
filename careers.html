            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                India is urbanizing at a faster rate than any country in human history.
                As crores of individuals migrate to cities over the next decade, it will
                be imperative to create sustainable mobility solutions for people to get
                around their city.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enter Zoomcar. We exist for a simple reason: we want to drive India's
                transformation to sustainable transportation. Unlike other providers,
                Zoomcar is laser focused on creating self-drive solutions for the
                current mobility predicament. It's still early days and while the road
                before us will certainly have many twists and turns, the sustainable
                light at the end of the tunnel is what motivates us day in, day out.
            </p>
            <p>
                With an intense focus on creating a world class user experience through
                technology, data science, and product, Zoomcar is determined to lead
                this revolution from the front. We're looking for similar mission driven
                individuals to join us on this self-driven quest. We look forward to
                hearing from you!

            <h2>Our Commandments</h2>

            <h3>Measure Measure Measure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can't improve what you can't measure; this is the core ethos
                    of Zoomcar and it touches every part of the business and applies
                    to every employee.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's critical to understand the core first principle metrics that
                    drive a certain outcome and then measure those religiously.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Consistent reflection on what to measure and why is absolutely
                    essential across all individuals.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Empathize Everywhere</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    From <strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong>, 'You never really
                    understand a person until you climb into his skin and walk around
                    in it.'
                </li>
                <li>
                    Empathy starts with consistent demonstrations across all
                    employees; then only can you show empathy to customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Listen first, think second, speak last; the hierarchy of empathy
                    never fails . Solicits inputs of others &amp; listens to different
                    point of view
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Improve Perpetually</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Stasis is death in a startup; without perpetual improvement we
                    simply can't achieve the impossible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Intense focus on incremental improvements on a daily basis;
                    looking for big bang improvements are akin to unicorn hunting...
                    it's in the trenches where real improvement happens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improvement is really a team sport and it can't happen without the
                    support of your peers; support systems matter and are worshipped
                    at Zoomcar
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Experiment Daily</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We're a collection of tinkerers at Zoomcar; we love iterating and
                    believe this is the key to consistent progress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All employees should have 2-3 experiments running at all times;
                    this helps us iterate faster and tightens the overall feedback
                    loop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Experimentation embodies our earlier principles of measurement and
                    perpetual improvement.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cross Train</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Irrespective of your function, at Zoomcar we believe that all
                    individuals must possess a robust 360 degree view on the business.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Versatility is key at a startup and training employees in other
                    functions helps build deeper engagement and understanding across
                    employees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensures empathy quotients are high across functions and helps
                    promote stronger communication and faster, higher quality
                    execution.
